#### **Course description and learning outcome:**

This workshop is connected to PCB5423 course, and it will be a co-requisite and will be offered to students enrolled in this course. The workshop is designed to provide an active learning experience by analyzing and illustrating several of the topics that will be discussed in PCB5423 by using ecological models and analytical tools. Specifically, R programming language will be used to learn and implement ecological models and analytical tools and discuss ecological fundamentals using quantitative examples. R is becoming one of the most used programming platforms to analyze and illustrate ecological patterns/data; thus, we hope to introduce novice and beginner coders to this fantastic programming language.

#### **When and where:**

*In-Person Sessions:* Lectures and hands-on programming/modeling exercises will be an integral part of the workshop’s learning experience; thus, most sessions will be based on face-to-face meetings to facilitate learning and assistance during the workshop sessions. In-person sessions will be offered only at BBC.

*Remote Lectures:* I will use Zoom to teach remotely if our face-to-face class cannot meet as regularly scheduled. I will contact you using CANVAS and email about Zoom link details. Also, I will use Zoom for remote lectures when I expect to be out of town for fieldwork or meetings. I will announce any changes to the schedule one week or more in advance.

*Office hours:* Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:00 – 4:00 pm, or by appointment. Please request a Zoom link by email or pass by my office for office hours meetings. I am constantly in/out of my office since my lab spaces are not in MSB; thus, please send me an email or talk to me after the workshop lectures to set up a meeting at my office.

#### Teaching schedule:

Changes to this schedule and other announcements regarding the course will be posted in CANVAS (sent FIU email addresses only).

#### **Learning materials:**

Textbook for R exercises (S) Stevens, M.H.H. 2010. A primer of ecology with R. ISBN 978-0-387-89881-0 (Electronically available at FIU Library)\
   E-book version: <https://hankstevens.github.io/Primer-of-Ecology/>

Other learning materials: required R scripts/files and readings for the workshop exercises will be posted to CANVAS and the workshop website <https://bsc6926-b52-fall2023.github.io/>.

**Please bring a laptop to class** so you can follow the R scripts during class and perform workshop exercises. Please, contact us if you do not have access to a laptop

R and R studio are free software environment for statistical computing and graphics required for the workshop. Please download it to your laptops:\
   Download R: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>\
   Download Rstudio: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

There is also an R package (EcoVirtual) you can use to run various models included on this website: <http://ecovirtual.ib.usp.br/doku.php?id=start>\

#### **Teaching:** 
A lectures and R programming exercises will be part of each workshop session to introduce several topics on population and community modeling and analyses and provide context to the ecological fundamentals taught in PCB5423. The grade will be based on participation, homework exercises, and final project (see below).  

#### **Grading:** 
The final grade will be composed of 2 assignments/tasks. These three assignments/tasks are: 1) Class participation (attendance and class exercises) and 2) R exercises homeworks.   

**Class participation (Total 10 pts)** will count for 25% of your final grade. This grade will consist of attending class (0, 1) and participating in class discussions and exercises (0, 1). Class discussion includes asking and answering questions, insightful comments and suggestions, and helping peers. 

**R homework exercises (Total 75 pts – 25 pts/hw)** will count for 40% of your grade. After several R "lab"/workshop sessions, students will turn in an assignment showing proof that they ran some of the code in R and understood the outputs of the models. The programming/coding aspect of the homework can be completed as a collective effort of student teams; however, students should independently answer and submit the homework questions. Please, submit homework answers as pdf or word document and the R files showing the code used to answer the questions. 


#### **Rubric: **
Grade scale is: A: 100-90; B: 89-80; C: <79 This is a graduate-level workshop; thus, if you are taking this course is because you have a genuine interest in ecological learning and developing your academic career. For this reason, I think final grades should be pass (A or B) or no pass (C). I will be somewhat lenient to allow for critical thinking, creativeness, and thoughtfulness. Whether you receive an A or B will depend on how well you do in the final report and how often you attend class and participate. I will give students a C (or less) who didn't commit to the work.      

Students will be graded on their performance in the above areas ONLY. Future career plans will have ZERO influence on the grade you receive in this class. Incomplete grades will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances. 

#### **Make-up policy: **
I will provide make-up opportunities only when students present valid excuses (e.g., medical/family emergencies, COVID-19 related emergency and precaution, major fieldwork trips, or conferences). Regardless of the reason, please contact me to identify alternative methods for completing course requirements, depending on the type of assignment missed and the severity of missed assignments. Below is a guideline of potential make-up scenarios/methods (Subject to change): 
-   *Participation* – Due to the limited number of sessions, I will provide a participation point for only one missed session with a validated and accepted excuse.
-   *Homework* – Make-up alternatives only for medical (including COVID-19) emergencies. The make-up will consist of submitting the homework materials at a later date (e.g., 48-72 hours after the submission deadline), depending on the gravity of the emergency.
