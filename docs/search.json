    "text": "R and RStudio\nR and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. In the sections below are the instructions for installing R and R Studio on your operating system.\n\nWindows\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check here for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows 10/11 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install it\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.15+ (64-bit) (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nFollow the instructions for your distribution from CRAN, they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base, and for Fedora sudo yum install R), but we don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb at the terminal).\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages."

The workshop is designed to provide an active learning experience by analyzing and illustrating several of the topics that will be discussed in PCB5423 by using ecological models and analytical tools. Specifically, R programming language will be used to learn and implement ecological models and analytical tools and discuss ecological fundamentals using quantitative examples. R is becoming one of the most used programming platforms to analyze and illustrate ecological patterns/data; thus, we hope to introduce novice and beginner coders to this fantastic programming language.\n\n\nWhen and where:\nIn-Person Sessions: Lectures and hands-on programming/modeling exercises will be an integral part of the workshop’s learning experience; thus, most sessions will be based on face-to-face meetings to facilitate learning and assistance during the workshop sessions. In-person sessions will be offered only at BBC.\nRemote Lectures: I will use Zoom to teach remotely if our face-to-face class cannot meet as regularly scheduled. I will contact you using CANVAS and email you the details of the Zoom link. Also, I will use Zoom for remote lectures when I expect to be out of town for fieldwork or meetings. I will announce any changes to the schedule one week or more in advance.\nOffice hours: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:00 – 4:00 pm, or by appointment. Please request a Zoom link by email or pass by my office for office hours meetings. I am constantly in/out of my office since my lab spaces are not in MSB; thus, please send me an email or talk to me after the workshop lectures to set up a meeting at my office.\n\n\nTeaching schedule:\nChanges to this schedule and other announcements regarding the course will be posted in CANVAS (sent FIU email addresses only).\n\n\n\nLearning materials:\nTextbook for R exercises (S) Stevens, M.H.H. 2010.

Please, contact us if you do not have access to a laptop\nR and R studio are free software environment for statistical computing and graphics required for the workshop. Please download it to your laptops:\n   Download R: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\n   Download Rstudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\nMaterials and links on R programming and statistical analyses helpful in learning R and the workshop exercises/homework/project\n\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund – An introduction to programming with R: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\n\nQuick-R by datacamp: Quick overview on R programming and statistical approaches.There are more tutorials, but you will be required to register\n\nRStudio Cloud Training Exercises: https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers\n\nVirtual Ecology Portal/EcoVirtual R Package: Website that provides various examples of population and community models that will be discussed in class and the workshop. There is also an R package (EcoVirtual) you can use to run various models included on this website: http://ecovirtual.ib.usp.br/doku.php?id=start\n\nModernDive: Introductory book on R and statistical inference: https://moderndive.com/index.html\n\n\n\nTeaching:\nLectures and R programming exercises will be part of each workshop session to introduce several topics on population and community modeling and analyses and provide context to the ecological fundamentals taught in PCB5423. The grade will be based on participation, homework exercises, and final project (see below).\n\n\nGrading:\nThe final grade will be composed of 2 assignments/tasks. These two assignments/tasks are: 1) Class participation (attendance and class exercises) and 2) R exercises homework.\nClass participation (Total 10 pts) will count for 25% of your final grade. This grade will consist of attending, participating, and submitting R exercises (0, 1). After each workshop, you will be asked to do and submit the results of a series of R exercises that you will try to answer to the best of your knowledge. Class discussion includes asking and answering questions, insightful comments and suggestions, and helping peers.\nR homework exercises (Total 75 pts – 25 pts/hw) will count for 75% of your grade. After several R “lab”/workshop sessions, students will turn in an assignment showing proof that they ran some of the code in R and understood the outputs of the models. The programming/coding aspect of the homework can be completed as a collective effort of student teams; however, students should independently answer and submit the homework questions. Please submit homework answers as PDFs or Word following a Markdown or Quarto format and the R files showing the code used to answer the questions.\n\n\nRubric: \nGrade scale is A: 100-90; B: 89-80; C: &lt;79. This is a graduate-level workshop; thus, if you are taking this course, it is because you have a genuine interest in ecological learning and developing your academic career. For this reason, I think final grades should be pass (A or B) or no pass (C). I will give students a C (or less) who didn’t commit to the work.\nStudents will be graded on their performance in the above areas ONLY. Future career plans will have ZERO influence on the grade you receive in this class. Incomplete grades will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\nMake-up policy: \nI will provide make-up opportunities only when students present valid excuses (e.g., medical/family emergencies, COVID-19-related emergencies and precautions, major fieldwork trips, or conferences). Regardless of the reason, please contact me to identify alternative methods for completing course requirements, depending on the type of assignment missed and the severity of missed assignments. Below is a guideline of potential make-up scenarios/methods (Subject to change): - Participation – Due to the limited number of sessions, I will award a participation point for only one missed session with a validated and accepted excuse. - Homework – Make-up alternatives only for medical (including COVID-19) emergencies. The make-up will consist of submitting the homework materials at a later date (e.g., 48-72 hours after the submission deadline), depending on the gravity of the emergency.\n\n\nFIU Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy Statement (Title IX):\nFlorida International University (the University) is committed to encouraging and sustaining a learning and living environment that is free from discrimination based on sex, including gender, gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
