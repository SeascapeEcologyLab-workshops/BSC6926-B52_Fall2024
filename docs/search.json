    "text": "R and RStudio\nR and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. In the sections below are the instructions for installing R and R Studio on your operating system.\n\nWindows\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check here for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows 10/11 (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install it\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running.

If so, please download and install it.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.15+ (64-bit) (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nFollow the instructions for your distribution from CRAN, they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base, and for Fedora sudo yum install R), but we don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb at the terminal).\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages."

The workshop is designed to provide an active learning experience by analyzing and illustrating several of the topics that will be discussed in PCB5423 by using ecological models and analytical tools. Specifically, R programming language will be used to learn and implement ecological models and analytical tools and discuss ecological fundamentals using quantitative examples. R is becoming one of the most used programming platforms to analyze and illustrate ecological patterns/data; thus, we hope to introduce novice and beginner coders to this fantastic programming language.\n\n\nWhen and where:\nIn-Person Sessions: Lectures and hands-on programming/modeling exercises will be an integral part of the workshop’s learning experience; thus, most sessions will be based on face-to-face meetings to facilitate learning and assistance during the workshop sessions. In-person sessions will be offered only at BBC.\nRemote Lectures: I will use Zoom to teach remotely if our face-to-face class cannot meet as regularly scheduled. I will contact you using CANVAS and email you the details of the Zoom link. Also, I will use Zoom for remote lectures when I expect to be out of town for fieldwork or meetings. I will announce any changes to the schedule one week or more in advance.\nOffice hours: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:00 – 4:00 pm, or by appointment. Please request a Zoom link by email or pass by my office for office hours meetings. I am constantly in/out of my office since my lab spaces are not in MSB; thus, please send me an email or talk to me after the workshop lectures to set up a meeting at my office.\n\n\nTeaching schedule:\nChanges to this schedule and other announcements regarding the course will be posted in CANVAS (sent FIU email addresses only).\n\n\n\nLearning materials:\nTextbook for R exercises (S) Stevens, M.H.H. 2010.

The grade will be based on participation, homework exercises, and final project (see below).\n\n\nGrading:\nThe final grade will be composed of 2 assignments/tasks. These two assignments/tasks are: 1) Class participation (attendance and class exercises) and 2) R exercises homework.\nClass participation (Total 10 pts) will count for 25% of your final grade. This grade will consist of attending, participating, and submitting R exercises (0, 1). After each workshop, you will be asked to do and submit the results of a series of R exercises that you will try to answer to the best of your knowledge. Class discussion includes asking and answering questions, insightful comments and suggestions, and helping peers.\nR homework exercises (Total 75 pts – 25 pts/hw) will count for 75% of your grade. After several R “lab”/workshop sessions, students will turn in an assignment showing proof that they ran some of the code in R and understood the outputs of the models. The programming/coding aspect of the homework can be completed as a collective effort of student teams; however, students should independently answer and submit the homework questions. Please submit homework answers as PDFs or Word following a Markdown or Quarto format and the R files showing the code used to answer the questions.\n\n\nRubric: \nGrade scale is A: 100-90; B: 89-80; C: &lt;79. This is a graduate-level workshop; thus, if you are taking this course, it is because you have a genuine interest in ecological learning and developing your academic career. For this reason, I think final grades should be pass (A or B) or no pass (C). I will give students a C (or less) who didn’t commit to the work.\nStudents will be graded on their performance in the above areas ONLY. Future career plans will have ZERO influence on the grade you receive in this class. Incomplete grades will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\nMake-up policy: \nI will provide make-up opportunities only when students present valid excuses (e.g., medical/family emergencies, COVID-19-related emergencies and precautions, major fieldwork trips, or conferences). Regardless of the reason, please contact me to identify alternative methods for completing course requirements, depending on the type of assignment missed and the severity of missed assignments. Below is a guideline of potential make-up scenarios/methods (Subject to change): - Participation – Due to the limited number of sessions, I will award a participation point for only one missed session with a validated and accepted excuse. - Homework – Make-up alternatives only for medical (including COVID-19) emergencies. The make-up will consist of submitting the homework materials at a later date (e.g., 48-72 hours after the submission deadline), depending on the gravity of the emergency.\n\n\nFIU Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy Statement (Title IX):\nFlorida International University (the University) is committed to encouraging and sustaining a learning and living environment that is free from discrimination based on sex, including gender, gender expression, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Discrimination based on sex encompasses Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment, Gender-Based Harassment, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and/or Stalking https://dei.fiu.edu/civil-rights-and-accessibility/index.html.\n\nFIU is committed to eliminating sexual harassment. In accordance with the FIU Faculty Senate guidelines, this syllabus includes a warning that any misconduct will be reported. FIU’s sexual harassment policy is available at: https://dei.fiu.edu/civil-rights-and-accessibility/sexual-misconduct/index.html\n\n\nProfessional and academic integrity:\nStudents are encouraged to employ critical thinking and rely on data and verifiable sources to interrogate all assigned readings and subject matter in this course as a way of determining whether they agree with their classmates and/or their instructor. No lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling, perception, viewpoint, or belief.\nFIU is a community dedicated to generating and imparting knowledge through excellent teaching and research, the rigorous and respectful exchange of ideas, and community service.

    "section": "Types of data structures in R",
    "text": "Types of data structures in R\nR has 6 basic data types. (In addition to the five listed below, there is also raw which will not be discussed in this workshop.)\n\ninteger\nnumeric (real or decimal)\ncharacter\nlogical\ncomplex\n\nintegers are whole numbers\nnumeric are numbers with decimals. Integers and numeric are different because of how the underlying data is stored. Other programming languages can use something similar as decimal, float, or double data types, which all slightly differ in how data is stored but are numbers that include decimals.\ncharacters are strings of letters and numbers (e.g. \"abc\" and \"b1x\") and are designated in R by \" \". When using characters, \" \" are required because in R letters without quotations are objects and c = 'd' is different than c = d\nlogical is TRUE or FALSE. One thing to note is that T is the same as TRUE and F is the same as FALSE. Because T and F are special in R they cannot be used to name objects (but t and f are ok because R is case sensative). This is true for other cases as well like NA and NULL.\ncomplex numbers have both real and imaginary parts (1+4i)\nElements of these data types may be combined to form data structures, such as atomic vectors. When we call a vector atomic, we mean that the vector only holds data of a single data type. A vector is the most common and basic data structure in R and is pretty much the workhorse of R. Technically, vectors can be one of two types: + atomic vectors + lists although the term “vector” most commonly refers to the atomic types not to lists. Lists differ because they can take on different data structures and can be more complex.\nThere are different ways to make vectors\n\n\n# make a numeric vector\na = c(1.1,5,3,4)\na\n## [1] 1.1 5.0 3.0 4.0\n\n# make a integer vector\nb = 1:15\nb\n##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\n# make a character vector \nc = c('a', 'b', 'c')\nc \n## [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\nBecause characters can be both letters and numbers, numbers in a vector with letters are stored as a character. These cannot be used for math operations, but integers and numeric data types can be used for math.\n\na = 4.4\na / 1 \n## [1] 4.4\n\n\nb = 6L # L can be used to keep a numeric as an integer, R typically defaults to numeric\nb*3\n## [1] 18\n\n# character\nc = '1'\nc*4\n## Error in c * 4: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\nAnother common way to store data is in a dataframe or tibble (special type of dataframe from the tidyverse package we will see below). This is a collection of atomic vectors with the same length.\n\nb = data.frame(c1 = c(1,2,3), c2 = c('a','b','c'))\nb\n##   c1 c2\n## 1  1  a\n## 2  2  b\n## 3  3  c"

When reading in tabular data, read.csv() will create a dataframe, while read_csv() will generate a tibble. read_csv() can be paired with url() to use data directly from the internet from sites like github. Note that if from github the raw file (click on raw tab when looking at github file) is needed for this to work. Similar to reading in data, dataframes and tibbles can be saved as .csv with write.csv() or write_csv().\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# create a dataframe\n\ndf = data.frame(name = c('GOOG', 'AMC', 'GME'),\n                Jan = c(1000, 2, 4),\n                Feb = c(1010, 15, 30),\n                March = c(1005, 25, 180))\n\ndf\n##   name  Jan  Feb March\n## 1 GOOG 1000 1010  1005\n## 2  AMC    2   15    25\n## 3  GME    4   30   180\n\n# create a tibble\ntib = tibble(name = c('GOOG', 'AMC', 'GME'),\n             Jan = c(1000, 2, 4),\n             Feb = c(1010, 15, 30),\n             March = c(1005, 25, 180))\n\ntib\n## # A tibble: 3 × 4\n##   name    Jan   Feb March\n##   &lt;chr&gt;
